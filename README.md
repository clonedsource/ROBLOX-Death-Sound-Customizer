# ROBLOX-Death-Sound-Customizer
A Death Sound Customizer for ROBLOX made entirely in Rust. Compiled to .exe for normal people's convenience cuz not everyone has rustc or cargo downloaded, and .exe can be run on nearly every windows OS. Might add MacOS Support later on, but I don't have a MacOS machine, so that isn't exactly possible for me currently.

## SUPPORTED OS
Windows: **YES** (Vista, XP, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11)

MacOs: **NO**

Other(s): **NO**

## SUPPORTED AUDIO FORMATS
.mp3

.ogg

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download the ZIP of the program under "Code <>".
2. Extract the ZIP wherever you want-- shouldn't affect it.
3. Find the "hit" folder in the extracted folder.
4. Replace the "tetris.ogg" file with any audio files of the supported audio formats. **NOTE: THERE CAN ONLY BE 1 FILE IN THE HIT FOLDER!**
5. Run the exe file (RBLX_Death_Customizer.exe).
6. Run ROBLOX.

## FOOTNOTE
* If the program doesn't work-- dm me on discord-- clone#7782.

* You will have to rerun this everytime roblox does an update, you'll know this because roblox has a ui for when it updates, so just a note for that I guess.
