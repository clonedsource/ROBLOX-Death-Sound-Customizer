# ROBLOX-Death-Sound-Customizer
A Death Sound Customizer for ROBLOX made entirely in Rust.

Hey, there can only be 1 file in the "hit" folder for this, supported file formats are .ogg and .mp3!

as soon as there is 1 audio file in the "hit" folder, you can run the exe where it will then make an old folder, containing all audio files that you've used with the program, it will replace the sfx into the folder of your roblox automatically, but if it doesnt-- make sure to dm me on discord-- clone#7782.
